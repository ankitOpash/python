# F-Strings

# F-String was introduced in Python 3.6, and is now the preferred way of formatting strings.

# To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an f in front of the string literal, and add curly brackets {}
#  as placeholders for variables and other operations.


age = 36
txt = f"My name is John, I am {age}"
